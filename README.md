# Simplified Adore Rootkit

This is the base source for the Rootkit Assignment for ComputerSecurity/Information Security and Privacy.

The adore rootkit is old, but it's simplicity makes it a very good candidate for studying rootkits. An added bonus is that it uses interpositioning, which is also what we use for the Reference Monitor assignment.
